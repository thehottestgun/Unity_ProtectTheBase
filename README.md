# Unity_ProtectTheBase
A for fun Unity project. You're a space base that's constantly attacked by aliens! Try to fend them all off!

Use Left/Right or A/D to rotate the base. 
CTRL or left mouse button to shoot!
The game speeds up every ten twenty points (except for the first level up at 10 points!) to heat up the action :D 
It is by no means fully done, a lot of polishing and possible stuff to do (weapon upgrades? :0)

Shoot and enemy deaths sounds have been yoinked from here: https://www.classicgaming.cc/classics/space-invaders/sounds
Awesome website, give it a look.
